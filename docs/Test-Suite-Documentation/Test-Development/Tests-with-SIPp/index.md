[SIPp](http://sipp.sourceforge.net/doc/reference.html) is an external tool that can be used to drive SIP related tests. The Asterisk Test Suite utilizes SIPp for a number of SIP channel driver tests, and provides several classes to help orchestrate SIPp in conjunction with instance(s) of Asterisk.

SIPp, its installation, operation, and the writing of SIPp scenarios are outside the scope of this document. In general, it is assumed that SIPp has been compiled with TLS/PCAP support, as that provides the greatest amount of flexibility in its usage.
