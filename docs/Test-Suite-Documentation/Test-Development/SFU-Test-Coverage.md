title: SFU Test Coverage
pageid: 40141070

Overview
========

Asterisk 15 introduced a new feature that allows you to utilize multiple streams (both audio and video) to create cool applications for things like video conferencing. Some tests were created to ensure that everything is working as intended, and this wiki page aims to document those tests as well as older ones that are still relevant to SFU (selective forwarding unit) test coverage. This will help us understand the depth of coverage we have for SFU testing and what needs to be done in the future to provide a solid foundation.




!!! tip 
    To get started with SFU testing and WebRTC, look at [WebRTC tutorial using SIPML5](/Configuration/WebRTC/WebRTC-tutorial-using-SIPML5).

!!! note 
    This page covers areas that are catered towards SFU coverage with streams. Other things, such as fax, will need to be investigated as well but have been left out for the purpose of this page.

Improvements
------------

While we do have decent test coverage, there's always room for improvements! This list can and should be contributed to with scenarios that will help strengthen SFU test coverage.

* bundled
	+ accept inbound offer with multiple audio streams and one video stream and bundled enabled
	+ accept inbound offer with multiple audio and video streams and bundled enabled
* audio-video
	+ accept inbound offer with audio and video then remove all audio streams
	+ accept inbound offer with audio and video then remove all video streams
	+ add a video stream once a call has been established with audio and video
	+ decline inbound offer with no streams
* video
	+ accept inbound offer with multiple video streams then hold a certain number of video streams
	+ accept inbound offer with multiple video streams then add an audio stream
	+ accept inbound offer with multiple video streams, but only allow the maximum allowed number (max_video_streams)
	+ offer a set of codecs with multuple video codecs and get them back in priority order
	+ test holding a video stream with a re-invite as well as unholding
* audio
	+ accept inbound offer with multiple audio streams then hold a certain number of audio streams
	+ accept inbound offer with multiple audio streams, then add a video stream
	+ accept inbound offer with multiple audio streams, but only allow the maximum allowed number (max_audio_streams)
* outbound
	+ one instance of Asterisk originates an outgoing call with audio and video to SIPp with audio and video, which should succeed, and each side should recieve the other's audio and video steam
	+ one instance of Asterisk originates an outgoing call with audio and video to SIPp with audio only, which should succeed, but SIPp will receive both of the streams from Asterisk while Asterisk receives only the audio stream from SIPp
	+ one instance of Asterisk originates an outgoing call with one audio stream and multiple video streams to SIPp with audio and video, which should succeed with all streams accepted
	+ one instance of Asterisk originates an outgoing call with multiple audio streams and one video stream to SIPp with audio and video, which should succeed with all streams accepted
	+ one instance of Asterisk originates an outgoing call with multiple audio and video streams to SIPp with audio and video, which should succeed with all streams accepted
* general media

The above scenarios are more general. If we get into more specific scenarios (like ConfBridge), things still need to work. Certain APIs may be needed for this, such as abiltiy to pull down stream topology. Here's a list of scenarios that could be tested and make use of said API.

* confbridge
	+ add a large number of users with audio and video, leave conference running for an extended amount of time, then check to see if something went wrong
	+ add user with audio and video, check topology to make sure it's in the correct state, add another user with audio and video, check topology again
	+ add user with audio and video, check topology, remove user, check topology
	+ add user with audio and video, check topology, add another user with some different audio or video codecs, check topology, remove a user, check topology
	+ add user with only audio, check topology
	+ add user with only audio, check topology, add user with audio and video, check topology
	+ add user with audio and video, check topology, add user with only audio, check topology
	+ add user with only audio, check topology, add two more users with audio and video, check topology, remove user with only audio, check topology
	+ add user with only video, check topology
	+ add user with only video, check topology, add user with audio and video, check topology
	+ add user with audio and video, check topology, add user with only video, check topology
	+ add user with only video, check topolgoy, add two more users with audio and video, check topology, remove user with only video, check topology
	+ add user with only audio, check topology, add user with only video, check topology
	+ add user with only video, check topology, add user with only audio, check topology

These scenarios provide a thorough testing of stream topologies and some unique interactions with different setups. As for unit tests, here are some more that could be added to the current list.

* test_stream.c

There is a chance that some cases won't be caught in unit tests due to timing since the environment will be under ideal circumstances.

Future API changes should also come with a set of tests to ensure everything is working as it should. These changes could include the items below.

* bridge
	+ ability to fetch and manipulate stream topology (through AMI / ARI)
* endpoint
	+ ability to fetch and manipulate active / available streams on an endpoint (through AMI / ARI)

### Priorities

This list's purpose is to narrow down the above improvements and order them based on priority.

1. Set up a confbridge and add a user with audio and video. Make sure everything is in the appropriate state. Remove the user. Check the state again to ensure everything was cleaned up.
2. Set up a confbridge and add a user with audio and video. Add another user with audio and video (same codecs). Make sure everything is in the appropriate state. Remove the users. Check the state again to ensure everything was cleaned up.
3. Set up a confbridge and add a user with audio and video. Add another user with audio and video (different codecs). Make sure everything is in the appropriate state. Remove the users. Check the state again to ensure everything was cleaned up.
4. Set up a confbridge and add the standard maximum number of participants (16 streams default max, 8 users with audio and video). Make sure everything is in the correct state. Try to add one more, which should fail. Remove all users. Check the state again to ensure everything was cleaned up.
5. Set up a confbridge. Test with some audio only users.
	1. Add a user with audio only. Make sure everything is in the appropriate state. Add a user with audio and video. Check the state again. Remove the user with audio and video. Check the state again. Remove the last user. Check the state again to ensure everything was cleaned up.
	2. Add a user with audio and video. Make sure everything is in the appropriate state. Add a user with audio only. Check the state again. Remove the audio only user. Check the state again. Remove the last user. Check the state again to ensure everything was cleaned up.
6. Set up a confbridge with a packet sniffer (or something similar).  

	1. Add two users, both with audio and video. Make sure everything is in the correct state. Use the packet sniffer to ensure audio and video is being sent and received for both users. Remove the users. Check the state again to ensure everything was cleaned up.
	2. Add a user with audio and video. Add another user with audio only. Make sure everything is in the correct state. Use the packet sniffer to ensure that media is being sent and received for the appropriate users. Remove the users. Check the state again to ensure everything was cleaned up.
		1. Run through some basic scenarios to keep the gears turning.  
		
			1. Add two users with audio and video. Use the packet sniffer to make sure audio and video are being sent and received by both users.
			2. Add a user with audio and video. Add another user with audio only. Use the packet sniffer to make sure audio and video is being received by the audio only user, and the user with audio and video is only receiving audio.
		2. Run through these common scenarios that resulted in finicky behavior, e.g. this message popping up on Asterisk CLI when things go wrong: “res_pjsip_sdp_rtp.c: set_caps: No joint capabilities for ‘video’ media stream between our configuration ((vp8)) and incoming sdp ((ulaw))”.  
		
			1. Add a user with audio only. Add a user with audio and video. The user with audio only will be waiting for video. The packet sniffer should be used here to figure out if anything is actually being sent. Adding another user with audio and video results in all users receiving video. If the user that joined second leaves, the user with audio only loses video again.
			2. Add a user with audio and video. Add another user with audio and video. Add a third user with audio only. Then remove the first user that joined. The user with audio only will lose video.
			3. Add a user with audio and video. Add another user with audio only. Add a third user with audio and video. Remove the first user that joined. The user with audio only will lose video.
7. Set up a confbridge. Test with some video only users.  

	1. Add a user with video only. Make sure everything is in the appropriate state. Add a user with audio and video. Check the state again. Remove the user with audio and video. Check the state again. Remove the last user. Check the state again to ensure everything was cleaned up.
	2. Add a user with audio and video. Make sure everything is in the appropriate state. Add a user with video only. Check the state again. Remove the video only user. Check the state again. Remove the last user. Check the state again to ensure everything was cleaned up.
8. Accept an inbound offer with the maximum number of video streams. Try to add another video stream, which should result in a failure.
9. Accept an inbound offer with the maximum number of audio streams. Try to add another audio stream, which should result in a failure.
