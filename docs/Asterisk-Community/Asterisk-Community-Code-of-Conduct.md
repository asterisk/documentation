pageid: 27199698
---

The Asterisk community is a large group of individuals, representing many nations, ethnicities, ages, technical professions and specialities.  Working together on Asterisk can be a challenge with so many differing perspectives and backgrounds. Therefore to ensure the community is healthy, happy, and stress-free, participants in the Asterisk project agree to adhere to the following Community Code of Conduct.

Note that by joining and/or participating in the Asterisk community, you are agreeing that you accept and will adhere to the rules listed below, even if you do not explicitly state so.

Acceptable Behaviour
====================

Be considerate
--------------

* Experience levels vary. Don't assume that someone can understand your particular explanation.
* Keep in mind that English is a second language for many users.

Be respectful
-------------

* It is possible to strongly disagree without using harsh language or resorting to derogatory comments. If you disagree with someone, disagree with the argument, not the character of the person.
* Remember that everyone is entitled to an opinion.

Ask for help
------------

* If you don't know how to proceed with an aspect of development or documentation, ask for help! Always read the documentation, but don't be afraid to ask "silly" questions.
* When asking for help, take advantage of the resources that are available to you, including the [wiki](https://wiki.asterisk.org), [mailing list archives](http://lists.digium.com/mailman/listinfo/), and [Asterisk: The Definitive Guide](http://asteriskdocs.org/).

Take responsibility
-------------------

* If you did something wrong, apologize to the affected. Do your best to fix the issue and, if you can't, ask for help!
* If someone does take responsibility, be considerate.

Give credit
-----------

* Give proper credit to everyone involved In any contribution to the project, be it documentation, tests, code, or anything in between.
* If someone fails to give adequate contribution, gently remind them while being considerate. Assume that the omission was accidental, not malicious.

Unacceptable Behaviour
======================

The Asterisk project reserves the right to take action in safe-guarding the community from those that participate in unacceptable behaviour. Unacceptable behaviour involves:

* Flaming - Arguing in a disrespectful way, attacking the character of others, rabidly ranting about things you dislike and refusing to drop the topic.
* Trolling - Intentionally baiting others into flaming or heated arguments for the sake of argument or drama itself.
* Mean-spirited or offensive talk - This could be combinations of the above, being rude, vulgar, and generally offensive to others.

In general, if community moderators and administrators are receiving many complaints about your behaviour, then you are likely doing something wrong. If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything.

Consequences to bad behaviour may involve bans from communication forums or channels and restrictions on privileges within the community.

Complaints about members behaviour or appeals in regards to bans or loss of privilege can be sent to [asteriskteam@digium.com](mailto:asteriskteam@digium.com).

Open Community
==============

We invite anybody, from any company, locale, or even other projects to participate in the Asterisk project. Our community is open, and contribution is welcome. Diversity makes a project strong, and we are proud to include anyone who wants to collaborate with others in a respectful fashion.

Project Leadership
==================

The role of project leadership is handled by the founders of the Asterisk project, [Sangoma Technologies](https://www.sangoma.com/open-source/). As a member of the Asterisk community, Sangoma develops the project in co-operation with the overall Asterisk community. Community members are always welcome to take positions of leadership as [module maintainers](/Development/Asterisk-Open-Source-Maintainers) within the Asterisk project, particularly when they are the author of the module.

In addition to providing development resources for Asterisk itself, Sangoma provides community resources including the bug tracker, mailing lists, wiki, version control, continuous integration services, and other necessary project infrastructure. [Asterisk goals and objectives](/Development/Roadmap./Development/Roadmap/Asterisk-12-Projects/New-SIP-channel-driver/New-SIP-Channel-Driver-Architecture/res_sip-design/Roadmap) are decided upon along with the community at the annual [AstriDevCon 2019](/Development/Roadmap/AstriDevCon-2019) held at AstriCon. Development discussions take place on the public [asterisk-dev mailing list](http://lists.digium.com/mailman/listinfo/asterisk-dev) and the [#asterisk-dev](http://freenode.net/) IRC channel. More information on the development of Asterisk can be found on the Asterisk wiki.
