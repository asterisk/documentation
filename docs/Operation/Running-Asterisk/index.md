Running Asterisk from the Command Line
======================================

* By default, starting Asterisk will run it in the background:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk

# ps aux | grep asterisk
my_user 26246 2.0 4.1 2011992 165520 ? Ssl 16:35 0:16 asterisk

```
* In order to connect to a running Asterisk process, you can attach a **remote console** using the `-r` option:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk -r

```



!!! tip 
    The `-R` option will also attach a remote console - however, it will attempt to automatically reconnect to Asterisk if for some reason the connection is broken. This is particularly useful if your remote console restarts Asterisk.

      
[//]: # (end-tip)

On this Page* To disconnect from a connected remote console, simply hit **Ctrl+C**:

```
asterisk-server\*CLI> 
Disconnected from Asterisk server
Asterisk cleanly ending (0).
Executing last minute cleanups

```
* To shut down Asterisk, issue `core stop gracefully`:

```
asterisk-server\*CLI> core stop gracefully
Disconnected from Asterisk server
Asterisk cleanly ending (0).
Executing last minute cleanups

```



!!! tip 
    You can stop/restart Asterisk in many ways. See [Stopping and Restarting Asterisk From The CLI](/Operation/Running-Asterisk/Stopping-and-Restarting-Asterisk-From-The-CLI) for more information.

      
[//]: # (end-tip)

* You can start Asterisk in the foreground, with an attached **root console**, using the `-c` option:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk -c

Adding Verbosity
----------------

Asterisk provides a number of mechanisms to control the verbosity of its logging. One way in which this can be controlled is through the command line parameter `-v`. For each `-v` specified, Asterisk will increase the level of `VERBOSE` messages by 1. The following will create a console and set the `VERBOSE` message level to 2:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk -c -v -v

```

Command line parameters can be combined. The previous command can also be invoked in the following way:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk -cvv

```



!!! note 
    The `VERBOSE` message level set via the command line is only applicable if the `asterisk.conf` `verbose` setting is not set.

      
[//]: # (end-note)



### Remote Console Verbosity




!!! tip **  **This feature is only available in Asterisk 11 and later versions.
    ---


    The verboseness of a remote console is set independently of the verboseness of other consoles and the core. A root console can be created with no verboseness:
[//]: # (end-tip)


  
  

```
# asterisk -c

```

While a remote console can be attached to that Asterisk process with a different verbosity:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk -rvvv

```

Multiple remote consoles can be attached, each with their own verbosity:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk -rv

```

Executing as another User
-------------------------




!!! warning Do not run as root
    Running Asterisk as `root` or as a user with super user permissions is dangerous and not recommended. There are many ways Asterisk can affect the system on which it operates, and running as `root` can increase the cost of small configuration mistakes.

    For more information, see the [README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.md](https://github.com/asterisk/asterisk/blob/master/README-SERIOUSLY.bestpractices.md) file delivered with Asterisk.

      
[//]: # (end-warning)



Asterisk can be run as another user using the `-U` option:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk -U asteriskuser

```

Often, this option is specified in conjunction with the `-G` option, which specifies the group to run under:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk -U asteriskuser -G asteriskuser

```

When running Asterisk as another user, make sure that user owns the various directories that Asterisk will access:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# sudo chown -R asteriskuser:asteriskuser /usr/lib/asterisk
# sudo chown -R asteriskuser:asteriskuser /var/lib/asterisk
# sudo chown -R asteriskuser:asteriskuser /var/spool/asterisk
# sudo chown -R asteriskuser:asteriskuser /var/log/asterisk
# sudo chown -R asteriskuser:asteriskuser /var/run/asterisk
# sudo chown asteriskuser:asteriskuser /usr/sbin/asterisk

```

More Options
------------

There are many more command line options available. For more information, use the `-h` option:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk -h
Asterisk 11.9.0, Copyright (C) 1999 - 2014, Digium, Inc. and others.
Usage: asterisk [OPTIONS]
...

```

Running Asterisk as a Service
=============================

The most common way to run Asterisk in a production environment is as a service. Asterisk includes both a `make` target for installing Asterisk as a service, as well as a script - `live_asterisk` - that will manage the service and automatically restart Asterisk in case of errors.

* Asterisk can be installed as a service using the `make config` target:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# make config
 /etc/rc0.d/K91asterisk -> ../init.d/asterisk
 /etc/rc1.d/K91asterisk -> ../init.d/asterisk
 /etc/rc6.d/K91asterisk -> ../init.d/asterisk
 /etc/rc2.d/S50asterisk -> ../init.d/asterisk
 /etc/rc3.d/S50asterisk -> ../init.d/asterisk
 /etc/rc4.d/S50asterisk -> ../init.d/asterisk
 /etc/rc5.d/S50asterisk -> ../init.d/asterisk

```
* Asterisk can now be started as a service:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# service asterisk start
 * Starting Asterisk PBX: asterisk [ OK ] 

```
* And stopped:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# service asterisk stop
 * Stopping Asterisk PBX: asterisk [ OK ] 

```
* And restarted:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# service asterisk restart
 * Stopping Asterisk PBX: asterisk [ OK ] 
 * Starting Asterisk PBX: asterisk [ OK ]

```
Supported Distributions
-----------------------

Not all distributions of Linux/Unix are supported by the `make config` target. The following distributions are supported - if not using one of these distributions, the `make config` target may or may not work for you.

* RedHat/CentOS
* Debian/Ubuntu
* Gentoo
* Mandrake/Mandriva
* SuSE/Novell
