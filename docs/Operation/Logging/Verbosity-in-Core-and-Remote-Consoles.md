title: Verbosity in Core and Remote Consoles
pageid: 28315852

If one issues the "`core show settings`" command from the Asterisk CLI it will show both a "Root" and "Current" console verbosity levels.  This is because each console, core or remote has an independent verbosity setting.  For instance, if you start asterisk with the following command:

```
asterisk -cv

```

This starts Asterisk in console mode (will be the root console) with a verbose level set to "1".  Now if one issues a "`core show settings`" from this console's CLI the following should be observed (note, not showing all settings):

```
*CLI> core show settings

PBX Core settings
-----------------
...
Root console verbosity: 1
Current console verbosity: 1
...

```

A remote console can now be attached with an initial verbosity level of "3" and a "`core show settings`" on that console should show a root console verbosity of "1" and a current console verbosity of "3":

```
asterisk -rvvv

*CLI> core show settings

PBX Core settings
-----------------
...
Root console verbosity: 1
Current console verbosity: 3
...

```

Changing the root console's verbosity will be reflected on both:

```
*CLI> core set verbose 2
Console verbose was 1 and is now 2.
*CLI> core show settings

PBX Core settings
-----------------
...
Root console verbosity: 2
Current console verbosity: 2
...

```

and then on the remote console:

```
*CLI> core show settings

PBX Core settings
-----------------
...
Root console verbosity: 2
Current console verbosity: 3
...

```
