Here is a selection of basic logging commands to get you started with manipulating log settings at the Asterisk CLI.

##### core set verbose

Set the level of verbose messages to be displayed on the console. “0” or "off" means no verbose messages should be displayed. The silent option means the command does not report what happened to the verbose level. Equivalent to -v[v[...]] on start up.

`Usage: core set verbose [atleast] <level> [silent]`

##### core set debug

Set the level of debug messages to be displayed or set a module name to display debug messages from. "0" or "off" means no messages should be displayed. Equivalent to -d[d[...]] on start up.

`Usage: core set debug [atleast] <level> [module]`

##### logger show channels

`Usage: logger show channels`

##### logger reload

##### core show settings
