Single-line comments begin with the semicolon (;) character. The Asterisk configuration parser treats everything following the semicolon as a comment. To expand on our previous example:

```
[section-name]
setting=true

[another_section]
setting=false ; this is a comment
; this entire line is a comment
;awesome=true
; the semicolon on the line above makes it a
; comment, disabling the setting

```
