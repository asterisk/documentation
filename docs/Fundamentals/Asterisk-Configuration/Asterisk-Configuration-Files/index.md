If you haven't read it already, the [Asterisk Architecture](/Asterisk-Architecture) section will help you to understand the context within which the configuration files are used. The [Directory and File Structure](/Directory-and-File-Structure) will tell you exactly where to find the configuration files which we generalize in this section. See the [Configuration](/Configuration) section for information on how to configure files related to **specific** components of Asterisk.
