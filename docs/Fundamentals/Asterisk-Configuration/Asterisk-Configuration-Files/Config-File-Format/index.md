Asterisk is a very flexible telephony engine. With this flexibility, however, comes a bit of complexity. Asterisk has quite a few configuration files which control almost every aspect of how it operates. The format of these configuration files, however, is quite simple. The Asterisk configuration files are plain text files, and can be edited with any text editor.
