# PERIODIC_HOOK()

### Synopsis

Execute a periodic dialplan hook into the audio of a call.

### Description

For example, you could use this function to enable playing a periodic 'beep' sound in a call.<br>

<br>

To turn on:<br>

Set(BEEPID=$\{PERIODIC\_HOOK(hooks,beep,180)\})<br>

<br>

To turn off:<br>

Set(PERIODIC\_HOOK($\{BEEPID\})=off)<br>

<br>

To turn back on again later:<br>

Set(PERIODIC\_HOOK($\{BEEPID\})=on)<br>

<br>

It is important to note that the hook does not actually run on the channel itself. It runs asynchronously on a new channel. Any audio generated by the hook gets injected into the call for the channel PERIODIC\_HOOK() was set on.<br>

<br>

The hook dialplan will have two variables available. **HOOK\_CHANNEL** is the channel the hook is enabled on. **HOOK\_ID** is the hook ID for enabling or disabling the hook.<br>
