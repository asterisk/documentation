The Asterisk software can be installed on a wide range of platforms including various Linux distributions. As a project, however, we are only able to test and support a subset of them. The Asterisk project supports 32-bit and 64-bit x86 platforms using non-end of life CentOS, RHEL, Fedora, Ubuntu, and Debian Linux distributions. Support for other platforms and Linux distributions is best effort and is provided by the community. Any changes to allow such platforms must not hinder or break the project supported Linux distributions.






!!! warning 
    Note that due to changes and improvements in compilers it is possible for Linux distribution upgrades to result in old versions of Asterisk no longer building. If this occurs it is recommended to upgrade to the latest supported version of Asterisk.
