Sending messages from an Asterisk box can be used for a variety of reasons, including notification from any monitoring systems, email subject lines, etc. 


Receiving messages to an Asterisk box is typically used just to email the messages to someone appropriate - we email and texts that are received to our direct numbers to the appropriate person. Received messages could also be used to control applications, manage competitions, votes, post items to IRC, anything. 


Using a terminal such as a magic messenger, an Asterisk box could ask as a message centre sending messages to the terminal, which will beep and pop up the message (and remember 100 or so messages in its memory).
