By enabling IMAP Storage, Asterisk will use native IMAP as the storage mechanism for voicemail messages instead of using the standard file structure. 

Tighter integration of Asterisk voicemail and IMAP email services allows additional voicemail functionality, including:

* Listening to a voicemail on the phone will set its state to "read" in a user's mailbox automatically.
* Deleting a voicemail on the phone will delete it from the user's mailbox automatically.
* Accessing a voicemail recording email message will turn off the message waiting indicator (MWI) on the user's phone.
* Deleting a voicemail recording email will also turn off the message waiting indicator, and delete the message from the voicemail system.
