Besides INBOX, users should create "Old", "Work", "Family" and "Friends" IMAP folders at the same level of hierarchy as the INBOX. These will be used as alternate folders for storing voicemail messages to mimic the behavior of the current (file-based) voicemail system. 

Please note that it is not recommended to store your voicemails in the top level folder where your users will keep their emails, especially if there are a large number of emails. A large number of emails in the same folder(s) that you're storing your voicemails could cause a large delay as Asterisk must parse through all the emails. For example a mailbox with 100 emails in it could take up to 60 seconds to receive a response.
