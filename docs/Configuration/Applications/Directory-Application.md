The next application we'll cover is named **Directory()**, because it presents the callers with a dial-by-name directory. It asks the caller to enter the first few digits of the person's name, and then attempts to find matching names in the specified voice mail context in **voicemail.conf**. If the matching mailboxes have a recorded name greeting, Asterisk will play that greeting. Otherwise, Asterisk will spell out the person's name letter by letter.

```javascript title=" " linenums="1"
Directory([voicemail_context,[dialplan_context,[options]]])

```

The **Directory()** application takes three parameters:


#### voicemail_context


This is the context within **voicemail.conf** in which to search for a matching directory entry. If not specified , the **default** context will be searched.


#### dialplan_context


When the caller finds the directory entry they are looking for, Asterisk will dial the extension matching their mailbox in this context.


#### options


A set of options for controlling the dial-by-name directory. Common options include **f** for searching based on first name instead of last name and **e** to read the extension number as well as the name.




!!! tip
    To see the complete list of options for the Directory() application, type **core show application Directory**
    at the Asterisk CLI.

Let's add a dial-by-name directory to our dialplan. Simply add this line to your **users** context in **extensions.conf**:

```javascript title=" " linenums="1"
exten => 6501,1,Directory(vm-demo,users,ef)

```

Now you should be able to dial extension **6501** to test your dial-by-name directory.
