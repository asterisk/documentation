The [FEATURE](/latest_api/API_Documentation/Dialplan_Functions/FEATURE) and [FEATUREMAP](/latest_api/API_Documentation/Dialplan_Functions/FEATUREMAP) dialplan functions allow you to set some features.conf options on a per channel basis.




!!! info "**  To see what options are currently supported, look at the FEATURE and FEATUREMAP function descriptions. **These functions were added in Asterisk 11."
    At this time the functions do not work with custom features. Those are set with a channel variable as described in the [Custom Dynamic Features](/Configuration/Features/Custom-Dynamic-Features) section.
