    Overview
    --------

    Pre-dial handlers allow you to execute a dialplan subroutine on a channel before a call is placed but after the application performing a dial action is invoked. This means that the handlers are executed after the creation of the caller/callee channels, but before any actions have been taken to actually dial the callee channels. You can execute a dialplan subroutine on the caller channel and on each callee channel dialed.

    There are two ways in which a pre-dial handler can be invoked:

    * The '**B**' option in an application executes a dialplan subroutine on the caller channel before any callee channels are created.
    * The '**b**' option in an application executes a dialplan subroutine on each callee channel after it is created but before the call is placed to the end-device.

    Pre-dial handlers are supported in the [Dial](/Asterisk-11-Application_Dial) application and the [FollowMe](/Asterisk-11-Application_FollowMe) application.
[//]: # (end-info)


**WARNING!: WARNINGS**  
* As pre-dial handlers are implemented using [Gosub](/Asterisk-11-Application_Gosub) subroutines, they must be terminated with a call to [Return](/Asterisk-11-Application_Return).
* Taking actions in pre-dial handlers that would put the caller/callee channels into other applications will result in undefined behaviour. Pre-dial handlers should be short routines that do not impact the state that the dialing application assumes the channel will be in.

Syntax
------

For [Dial](/Asterisk-11-Application_Dial) or [FollowMe](/Asterisk-11-Application_FollowMe), handlers are invoked using similar nomenclature as other options (such as **M** or **U** in Dial) that cause some portion of the dialplan to execute.

```
b([[context^]exten^]priority[(arg1[^...][^argN])])
B([[context^]exten^]priority[(arg1[^...][^argN])])

```



!!! info ""
    If context or exten are not supplied then the current values from the caller channel are used.

Examples
--------

The examples illustrated below use the following channels:

* *SIP/foo* is calling either *SIP/bar*, *SIP/baz*, or both
* *SIP/foo* is the caller
* *SIP/bar* is a callee
* *SIP/baz* is another callee

#### Example 1 - Executing a pre-dial handler on the caller channel

```
[default]

exten => s,1,NoOp()
same => n,Dial(SIP/bar,,B(default^caller_handler^1))
same => n,Hangup()

exten => caller_handler,1,NoOp()
same => n,Verbose(0, In caller pre-dial handler!)
same => n,Return()

```



---

  
Example 1 CLI Output  

```
<SIP/foo-123> Dial(SIP/bar,,B(default^caller_handler^1))
<SIP/foo-123> Executing default,caller_handler,1
<SIP/foo-123> In caller pre-dial handler!
<SIP/foo-123> calling SIP/bar-124

```

#### Example 2 - Executing a pre-dial handler on a callee channel

```
[default]

exten => s,1,NoOp()
same => n,Dial(SIP/bar,,b(default^callee_handler^1))
same => n,Hangup()

exten => callee_handler,1,NoOp()
same => n,Verbose(0, In callee pre-dial handler!)
same => n,Return()

```



---

  
Example 2 CLI Output  

```
<SIP/foo-123> Dial(SIP/bar,,b(default^callee_handler^1))
<SIP/bar-124> Executing default,callee_handler,1
<SIP/bar-124> In callee pre-dial handler!
<SIP/foo-123> calling SIP/bar-124

```

#### Example 3 - Executing a pre-dial handler on multiple callee channels

```
[default]

exten => s,1,NoOp()
same => n,Dial(SIP/bar&SIP/baz,,b(default^callee_handler^1))
same => n,Hangup()

exten => callee_handler,1,NoOp()
same => n,Verbose(0, In callee pre-dial handler!)
same => n,Return()

```



---

  
Example 3 CLI Output  

```
<SIP/foo-123> Dial(SIP/bar&SIP/baz,,b(default^callee_handler^1))
<SIP/bar-124> Executing default,callee_handler,1
<SIP/bar-124> In callee pre-dial handler!
<SIP/baz-125> Executing default,callee_handler,1
<SIP/baz-125> In callee pre-dial handler!
<SIP/foo-123> calling SIP/bar-124
<SIP/foo-123> calling SIP/baz-125

```
