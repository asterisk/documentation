Dialplan Switch Statements
==========================

The **switch** statement permits a server to share the dialplan with another server. To understand when a switch would be searched for dialplan extensions you should read the [Contexts, Extensions, and Priorities](/Configuration/Dialplan/Contexts-Extensions-and-Priorities) section as it covers Dialplan search order.




!!! warning 
    Use with care: Reciprocal switch statements are not allowed (e.g. both A -> B and B -> A), and the switched server need to be on-line or else dialing can be severely delayed.

Basic switch statement
----------------------

As an example, with remote IAX switching you get transparent access to the remote Asterisk PBX.

```
[iaxprovider]
switch => IAX2/user:password@myserver/mycontext

```

The lswitch statement
---------------------

An "lswitch" is like a switch but is literal, in that variable substitution is not performed at load time but is passed to the switch directly (presumably to be substituted in the switch routine itself)

```
lswitch => Loopback/12${EXTEN}@othercontext

```

The eswitch statement
---------------------

An "eswitch" is like a switch but the evaluation of variable substitution is performed at runtime before being passed to the switch routine.

```
eswitch => IAX2/context@${CURSERVER}

```
