title: AEL about Applications
pageid: 4620458

Application calls, like "Dial()", or "Hangup()", or "Answer()", are available for users to use to accomplish the work of the dialplan. There are over 145 of them at the moment this was written, and the list grows as new needs and wants are uncovered. Some applications do fairly simple things, some provide amazingly complex services. 


Hopefully, the above objects will allow you do anything you need to in the Asterisk environment!
