Think of a macro as a combination of a context with one nameless extension, and a subroutine. It has arguments like a subroutine might. A macro call can be made within an extension, and the individual statements there are executed until it ends. At this point, execution returns to the next statement after the macro call. Macros can call other macros. And they work just like function calls.
