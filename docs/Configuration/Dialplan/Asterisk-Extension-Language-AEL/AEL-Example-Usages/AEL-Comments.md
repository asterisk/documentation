Comments begin with // and end with the end of the line. 

Comments are removed by the lexical scanner, and will not be recognized in places where it is busy gathering expressions to wrap in $[] , or inside application call argument lists. The safest place to put comments is after terminating semicolons, or on otherwise empty lines.
