Three keywords:

1. break
2. continue
3. return

are included in the syntax to provide flow of control to loops, and switches. 

The break can be used in switches and loops, to jump to the end of the loop or switch. 

The continue can be used in loops (while and for) to immediately jump to the end of the loop. In the case of a for loop, the increment and test will then be performed. In the case of the while loop, the continue will jump to the test at the top of the loop. 

The return keyword will cause an immediate jump to the end of the context, or macro, and can be used anywhere.
