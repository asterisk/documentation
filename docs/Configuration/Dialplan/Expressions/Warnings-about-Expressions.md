If you need to do complicated things with strings, asterisk expressions is most likely NOT the best way to go about it. AGI scripts are an excellent option to this need, and make available the full power of whatever language you desire, be it Perl, C, C++, Cobol, RPG, Java, Snobol, PL/I, Scheme, Common Lisp, Shell scripts, Tcl, Forth, Modula, Pascal, APL, assembler, etc.
