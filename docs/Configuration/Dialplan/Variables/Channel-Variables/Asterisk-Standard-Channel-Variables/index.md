There are a number of variables that are defined or read by Asterisk. Here is a listing of them. More information is available in each application's help text. All these variables are in UPPER CASE only.

Variables marked with a \* are builtin functions and can't be set, only read in the dialplan. Writes to such variables are silently ignored.

* ${CALLERID(ani)} \* - Caller ANI (PRI channels)
* ${CALLERID(ani2)} \* - ANI2 (Info digits) also called Originating line information or OLI
* ${CALLERID(all)} - Caller ID

* ${EXTEN} \* - Current extension
* ${ENV(VAR)} - Environmental variable VAR
