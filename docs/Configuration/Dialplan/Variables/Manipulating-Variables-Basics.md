It's often useful to do string manipulation on a variable. Let's say, for example, that we have a variable named **NUMBER** which represents a number we'd like to call, and we want to strip off the first digit before dialing the number. Asterisk provides a special syntax for doing just that, which looks like **${variable[:skip[:length]}**.

The optional **skip** field tells Asterisk how many digits to strip off the front of the value. For example, if **NUMBER** were set to a value of **98765**, then **${NUMBER:2}** would tell Asterisk to remove the first two digits and return **765**.

If the skip field is negative, Asterisk will instead return the specified number of digits from the end of the number. As an example, if **NUMBER** were set to a value of **98765**, then **${NUMBER:-2}** would tell Asterisk to return the last two digits of the variable, or **65**.

If the optional **length** field is set, Asterisk will return at most the specified number of digits. As an example, if **NUMBER** were set to a value of **98765**, then **${NUMBER:0:3}** would tell Asterisk not to skip any characters in the beginning, but to then return only the three characters from that point, or **987**. By that same token, **${NUMBER:1:3}** would return **876**.
