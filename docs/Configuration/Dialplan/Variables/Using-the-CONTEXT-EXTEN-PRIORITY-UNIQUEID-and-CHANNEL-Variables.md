title: Using the CONTEXT, EXTEN, PRIORITY, UNIQUEID, and CHANNEL Variables

Now that you've learned a bit about variables, let's look at a few of the variables that Asterisk automatically creates.

Asterisk creates channel variables named **CONTEXT**, **EXTEN**, and **PRIORITY** which contain the current context, extension, and priority. We'll use them in pattern matching (below), as well as when we talk about macros in [Section 308.10. Macros](/308.10.-Macros). Until then, let's show a trivial example of using **${EXTEN}** to read back the current extension number.

```
exten=>6123,1,SayNumber(${EXTEN})

```

If you were to add this extension to the **[users]** context of your dialplan and reload the dialplan, you could call extension **6123** and hear Asterisk read back the extension number to you.

Another channel variable that Asterisk automatically creates is the **UNIQUEID** variable. Each channel within Asterisk receives a unique identifier, and that identifier is stored in the **UNIQUEID** variable. The **UNIQUEID** is in the form of **1267568856.11**, where **1267568856** is the Unix epoch, and **11** shows that this is the eleventh call on the Asterisk system since it was last restarted.

Last but not least, we should mention the **CHANNEL** variable. In addition to a unique identifier, each channel is also given a channel name and that channel name is set in the **CHANNEL** variable. A SIP call, for example, might have a channel name that looks like **SIP/george-0000003b**, for example.
