title: Include Statements Basics
pageid: 4817357

To set the stage for our explanation of include statements, let's say that we want to organize our dialplan and create a new context called **features**. We'll leave our extensions **6001** and **6002** for Alice and Bob in the **users** context, and place extensions such as **6500** in the new **features** context. When calls come into the users context and doesn't find a matching extension, the include statement tells Asterisk to also look in the new **features** context.

The syntax for an include statement is very simple. You simply write **include =>** and then the name of the context you'd like to include from the existing context. If we reorganize our dialplan to add a **features** context, it might look something like this:

```
[users]
include => features

exten => 6001,1,Dial(SIP/demo-alice,20)
 same => n,VoiceMail(6001@vm-demo,u)

exten => 6002,1,Dial(SIP/demo-bob,20)
 same => n,VoiceMail(6002@vm-demo,u)

[features]
exten => 6000,1,Answer(500)
 same => n,Playback(hello-world)
 same => n,Hangup()

exten => 6500,1,Answer(500)
 same => n,VoiceMailMain(@vm-demo)

```



!!! tip Location of Include Statements** Please note that in the example above, we placed the include statement before extensions **6001** and **6002
    . It could have just as well come after.  


      
[//]: # (end-tip)





!!! warning Be careful with overlapping patterns/extensions
    Because Asterisk doesn't stop processing the dialplan after the first matching extension is found, always ensure that you don't have overlapping patterns or duplicate extensions among included contexts, or else you'll get an unexpected behavior.

How calling 6001 may go wrong  

```
[users]
include => features
include => catchall

exten => 6001,1,Dial(SIP/demo-alice,20) ; <- Priority 1
 same => n,VoiceMail(6001@vm-demo,u) ; <- Priority 2

exten => 6002,1,Dial(SIP/demo-bob,20)
 same => n,VoiceMail(6002@vm-demo,u)

[features]
exten => 6000,1,Answer(500)
 same => n,Playback(hello-world)
 same => n,Hangup()
exten => 6500,1,Answer(500)
 same => n,VoiceMailMain(@vm-demo)
 
[catchall]
exten => _.,1,NoOp();
exten => _.,2,NoOp();
exten => _.,3,NoOp(); ; <- Priority 3 ends up being here, which is NOT what you want
