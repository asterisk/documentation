title: Asterisk Builtin mini-HTTP Server
pageid: 28315001

Overview
========

The core of Asterisk provides a basic HTTP/HTTPS server.

Certain Asterisk modules may make use of the HTTP service, such as the [Asterisk Manager Interface](/Configuration/Interfaces/Asterisk-Manager-Interface-AMI) over HTTP, the [Asterisk Restful Interface](/Configuration/Interfaces/Asterisk-REST-Interface-ARI/Getting-Started-with-ARI) or WebSocket transports for modules that support that, like chan_sip or chan_pjsip.

Configuration
=============

The configuration sample file is [by default](/Fundamentals/Directory-and-File-Structure) located at /etc/asterisk/http.conf

A very basic configuration of http.conf could be as follows:

```
[general]
enabled=yes
bindaddr=0.0.0.0
bindport=8088

```

That configuration would enable the HTTP server and have it bind to all available network interfaces on port 8088.

Configuration Options
=====================

See the sample file in your version of Asterisk for detail on the various configuration options, as this information is not yet automatically pushed to the wiki.
