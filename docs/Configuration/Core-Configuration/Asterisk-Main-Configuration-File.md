The asterisk.conf file
======================

asterisk.conf is used to configure the locations of directories and files used by Asterisk, as well as options relevant to the core of Asterisk.

[Link to the asterisk.conf.sample](http://svnview.digium.com/svn/asterisk/trunk/configs/asterisk.conf.sample?view=markup) file in the Asterisk trunk subversion repo. The information below could become out of date, so always check the relevant sample file in our version control system.

asterisk.conf has two primary contexts, shown below with some descriptions about their content.

A Note on Includes
------------------

[Includes](/Fundamentals/Asterisk-Configuration/Asterisk-Configuration-Files/Using-The-include-tryinclude-and-exec-Constructs) in this file will only work with absolute paths, as the configuration in this file is setting the relative paths that would be used in includes set in other files.

Directories Context
-------------------

```
[directories](!)
astetcdir => /etc/asterisk
astmoddir => /usr/lib/asterisk/modules
astvarlibdir => /var/lib/asterisk
astdbdir => /var/lib/asterisk
astkeydir => /var/lib/asterisk
astdatadir => /var/lib/asterisk
astagidir => /var/lib/asterisk/agi-bin
astspooldir => /var/spool/asterisk
astrundir => /var/run/asterisk
astlogdir => /var/log/asterisk
astsbindir => /usr/sbin

```

The directories listed above are explained in detail in the [Directory and File Structure](/Fundamentals/Directory-and-File-Structure) page.

Options Context
---------------

Some additional annotation for each configuration option is included inline.




!!! note 
    TODO: Match this up with what is current in the sample, and update both.

[files]
; Changing the following lines may compromise your security 
; Asterisk.ctl is the pipe that is used to connect the remote CLI

; The file is created when Asterisk starts, in the "astrundir" above. 
;astctlpermissions = 0660
