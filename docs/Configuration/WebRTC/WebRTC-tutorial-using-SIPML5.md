Tutorial Overview
=================

This tutorial demonstrates basic WebRTC support and functionality within Asterisk.  Asterisk will be configured to support a remote WebRTC client, the [sipml5](https://www.doubango.org/sipml5/) client, for the purposes of making calls to/from Asterisk within a web browser.  You must be running a recent (as of September 2018) version of a Mozilla or Chromium based web browser.

Setup Asterisk
==============

Follow the instructions at [Configuring Asterisk for WebRTC Clients](/Configuration/WebRTC/Configuring-Asterisk-for-WebRTC-Clients) before proceeding,  The rest of this tutorial assumes that your PBX is reachable at `pbx.example.com` and that the client is known as `webrtc_client`.

Configure Asterisk Dialplan

We'll make a simple dialplan for receiving a test call from the sipml5 client.




---

  
/etc/asterisk/extensions.conf  

```
[default]
exten => 200,1,Answer()
same => n,Playback(demo-congrats)
same => n,Hangup()

```



This instructs Asterisk to Answer a call to "200," to play a file named "demo-congrats" (included in Asterisk's core sound file packages), and to hang up.  To make the extension active, either restart Asterisk or issue a "dialplan reload" command from the Asterisk CLI.

Browsers and WSS
================

When using WSS as a transport, Chrome and Firefox will not allow you, by default, to connect using WSS to a server with a self-signed certificate.  Rather, you'll have to install a publicly-signed certificate into Asterisk.  Or, you'll have to import the the self-signed certificate we made earlier into your browser's keychain, which is outside the scope of this Wiki. 

Or, for Firefox and Chrome, you can open a separate browser tab and point it to Asterisk's HTTPs server's TLS port and WS path, e.g. `https://pbx.example.com:8089/ws`, and you can manually confirm the security exception.

  


Configure SIPML5
================






!!! info ""
    SIPML5 is a useful client for testing Asterisk. Many real-world users explore other options that may include rolling your own client.

Next, visit <https://sipml5.org> - you'll be redirected to <https://www.doubango.org/sipml5/>

Once there, click the "Enjoy our live demo" link to be directed to the sipml5 client.

In the Registration box, use configuration similar to the following:

Here, we have input the following:

* Display Name is a free-form string
* Private Identity is our username from our PJSIP auth object
* Public Identity is in the format:
	+ sip : (name of our PJSIP aor object) @ (IP Address of the Asterisk system)
* Password is our password from our PJSIP auth object
* Realm is "asterisk.org"

Next, click the "Expert mode?" form button.  It will open a new browser tab.  In the Expert settings box, use a configuration similar to the following:

Here, we have made the following changes:

* Checked the "Disable Video" box
* Filled in the WebSocket Server URL using the format:
* Checked the "Disable 3GPP Early IMS" box

Click "Save" and return to the other demo tab with the Registration box.

Next, click "Login" and you should see *Connected* as such:

You should see a corresponding connection happen on the Asterisk CLI.  You can log into the Asterisk CLI by performing:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
# asterisk -vvvr

```



Then, you can LogOut and Login and see something like:

```
== WebSocket connection from '192.168.147.245:49976' for protocol 'sip' accepted using version '13'
-- Added contact 'sips:webrtc_client@192.168.147.245:49976;transport=ws;rtcweb-breaker=no' to AOR 'webrtc_client' with expiration of 200 seconds
== Endpoint webrtc_client is now Reachable

```

Make a test call
----------------

In the sipml5 Call control box input **200**.  Then press the Call button.  You'll see a drop-down:

Select "Audio" to continue.  Once you do this, Firefox will display a popup asking permission to use your microphone:

Click "Allow."

Next, the Call control box will indicate that the call is proceeding:

Finally, when the call is connected, you will see *In Call*:

![](Screen-Shot-2017-06-28-at-2.28.37-PM.png)

and you will hear "Congratulations, you have successfully installed and executed the Asterisk open source PBX..."

You've just made your first call via WebRTC using Asterisk!
