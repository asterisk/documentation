This section contains many sub-sections on configuring every aspect of Asterisk. Other than what is covered under [Core Configuration](/Configuration/Core-Configuration), most features and functionality are [provided by modules](/Fundamentals/Asterisk-Architecture/Types-of-Asterisk-Modules) that you may or may not have installed in your Asterisk system. Built-in configuration documentation for each module (that has documentation) can be accessed through the [Asterisk CLI](/Operation/Asterisk-Command-Line-Interface). The [CLI Syntax and Help Commands](/Operation/Asterisk-Command-Line-Interface/CLI-Syntax-and-Help-Commands) section has more information on accessing the module configuration help.
