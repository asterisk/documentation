Overview
========

 AGI is analogous to CGI in Apache. AGI provides an interface between the Asterisk dialplan and an external program that wants to manipulate a channel in the dialplan. In general, the interface is synchronous - actions taken on a channel from an AGI block and do not return until the action is completed.
