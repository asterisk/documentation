Using Swagger-UI
================

The REST API that makes up ARI is documented using [Swagger](https://developers.helloreverb.com/swagger/), a lightweight specification for documenting RESTful API's. The Swagger API docs are used to generate validations and boilerplate in Asterisk itself and interactive documentation using [Swagger-UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui).

[Swagger-UI](https://github.com/wordnik/swagger-ui) is a pure HTML+JavaScript application which can download Swagger api-docs, and generate an interactive web page which allows you to view resources, their operations, and submit API requests directly from the documentation. A fork of Swagger-UI is hosted on [ari.asterisk.org](http://ari.asterisk.org), which enables DELETE operations (which are disabled by default in Swagger-UI), and sets the default URL to what it would be running Asterisk on your local system.

In order to access ARI, you have to populate the `api_key` field with a `[username:password](http://usernamepassword)` configured in `ari.conf`. You should also set `allowed_origins` in `ari.conf` to allow the site hosting Swagger-UI to access ARI.

ari.conf  

```
truetext[general]
enabled=yes
;pretty=yes ; we don't need pretty-printing of the JSON responses in this
 ; example, but you might if you use curl a lot.
;
; In this example, we are going to use the version of Swagger-UI that is hosted
; at ari.asterisk.org. In order to get past CORS restrictions in the browser,
; That origin needs to be added to the allowed_origins list.

allowed_origins=http://ari.asterisk.org

;read_only=no ; Set to yes for read-only applications
