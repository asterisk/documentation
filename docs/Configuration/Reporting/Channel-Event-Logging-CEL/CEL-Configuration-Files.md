CEL General Configuration
=========================

Primary CEL configuration settings are located in `cel.conf`. Note that CEL only publishes record types to back-ends that are enabled in the general CEL configuration.

Back-end Configuration
======================

Configuration for specific logging or storage back-ends is located in separate configuration files. The exception is the AMI and RADIUS back-ends. Sample configurations are provided with the Asterisk 12 source for all of these back-ends.
