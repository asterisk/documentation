Call to users to test various video endpoints with ConfBridge and report findings to the Wiki.


Notes:


1.8.5 was released earlier this week. Has a large number of important fixes.


First Asterisk 1.10 beta "real soon now." Preparing all of the binary modules first, so release either tomorrow or on Tuesday.  

Over the next few months we'll be looking for as much testing assistance as possible


In recent weeks in 1.10, T.38 gateway support has been merged and is ready to be tested. Video support, with several different modes, has been added to ConfBridge.


Discussion surrounding production use of 1.8 series. Question posed about use in production and stability. Responders on call indicated that while they have run into sporadic issues, there is nothing preventing them from using 1.8 effectively.
