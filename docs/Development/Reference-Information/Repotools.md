Merge Tools
===========


The repotools Makefile installs the merge tools which are useful for simplifying the merging process for commits to Asterisk's various branches.  

Installation requires that you have repotools checked out (or otherwise available) and that you have expect. On Ubuntu/Debian, expect can be  

installed trivially with apt-get (usually with default repositories)

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
$ sudo apt-get install expect

```

Once expect is installed, the mergetools can be installed with the following steps:

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
$ svn co http://svn.asterisk.org/svn/repotools
$ cd repotools
$ ./configure
$ sudo make install

```

Other Requirements
==================


In addition to the mergetools, there are a number of scripts in repotools that we use for a variety of purposes. Some examples are automated  



jira-python
-----------


Scripts that retrieve issue information from JIRA now require the jira-python module. This is most easily obtained by using pip, which is  

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
$ sudo apt-get install python-pip

```

Once pip is installed, installing jira-python is simple (and similar)

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
$ sudo pip install jira-python

```

pysvn, diffstat, and links2
---------------------------


If you want to run the release summary building script, these tools are necessary. Like with most tools mentioned here, getting them with  

```bash title=" " linenums="1"
$ sudo apt-get install python-svn diffstat links2

```
