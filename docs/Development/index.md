This section includes information related to the core development of Asterisk. This includes:

* Project guidelines for source control set-up, branch management, and releases
* Information for submitting patches back to the project, participating in code reviews, and committing patches
* Examples for more complex frameworks in Asterisk
* The project roadmap, including the notes/results of previous Asterisk Developer Conferences (AstriDevCon)
* Project planning/coordination notes

And anything else developers can think of that can use a wiki page.

Most of the documentation related to the source code is embedded in the source files and is processed with [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.org). Doxygen can be generated on your system using "make progdocs" with doxygen installed.

 

The information on the pages in this section may be developer planning notes, which can differ quite a bit from the final implementation. Do **not** assume that a page in this section reflects the implemented behaviour in Asterisk!
