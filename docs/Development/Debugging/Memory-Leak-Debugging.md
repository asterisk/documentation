If Asterisk is crashing due to potential memory corruption then head to the [Getting a Backtrace (Asterisk versions < 13.14.0 and 14.3.0)](/Development/Debugging/Getting-a-Backtrace-Asterisk-versions-13.14.0-and-14.3.0) page.

If Asterisk developers suspect that you have a memory leak then you will be asked to follow the instructions below.
