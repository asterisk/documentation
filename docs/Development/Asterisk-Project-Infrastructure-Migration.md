Overview
========

In order to reduce the amount of system maintenance and administration that needs to be done by the Asterisk team at Sangoma, we've decided to move capabilities such as issue tracking, code management/review and documentation/wiki to hosted solutions. Last year, we compared GitHub and GitLab and while the evaluation of documentation/wiki alternatives is still ongoing, we've decided that GitHub offers the best alternative for issues and code management/review. The details of the comparison can be found in this wiki article: [Trade Study: Github vs. Gitlab](/Development/Asterisk-Project-Infrastructure-Future/Trade-Study-Github-vs.-Gitlab).

The [Asterisk Community Forums](https://community.asterisk.org) are already hosted by Discourse and are not moving but see below for additional authentication options.

Schedule
========

Over the weekend of April 29-30 2023, GitHub will become the official and sole platform for issue tracking and code management.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR US TO MIGRATE EITHER ISSUES OR CODE REVIEWS TO THE NEW PLATFORMS but the existing Jira issue tracker and Gerrit code management systems will be placed in read-only mode for historical reference.  At some point in the future, the historical issues in Jira will be exported to a searchable format and the system deactivated.  The Gerrit system will be deactivated at the same time but since the most important historical data is already captured as part of the commit history, there's no need to create a searchable archive. 

Authentication and Email
========================

If you don't already have one, you must create a GitHub account if you plan on reporting issues or contributing code.  If you've contributed code in the past, you should make sure that any email addresses you used in your commits is added in Settings/Emails.  You can now also use your GitHub account to log into the [Discourse hosted Asterisk Community Forums](https://community.asterisk.org).  Make sure the email you use for the forums is also listed under Settings/Emails in GitHub.
