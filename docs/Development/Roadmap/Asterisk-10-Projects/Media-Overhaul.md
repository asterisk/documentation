## Relevant Problems That Exist Today

* Codec negotiation (both with Asterisk, and across a bridge)
    * Support for audio codecs with attributes (SILK)
    * Support for video codecs with attributes
* Limitation on the number of codecs Asterisk can support
* Translation paths are audio specific (with no concept of attributes)
* There is no way to renegotiate codecs after a call is up
* Conferencing is limited to 8 kHz
* There is no way to easily get Asterisk to pass through a media type that it does not understand (proprietary data)
* Once Asterisk supports codecs with attributes, users will need to be able to specify codecs with attributes
* Asterisk is not able to handle a call with more than one audio/video/text stream (only one stream per type).
* Asterisk has no RTCP support relevant to audio and video synchronization
* Asterisk does not support Gtalk video

## Phase 1 Requirements

Rework media representation completely across all of Asterisk, while maintaining existing functionality. Only add functionality that is required to exercise what has been done.

* Design a new way to represent codecs
    * translation interface
    * capabilities
    * ast_frame handling
    * Initial call setup codec negotiation
    * everything that touches media ...
* Exercise what we have done so far
    * Add support for SILK (and its attributes)
    * Add support for H.264 attributes
* Custom format definitions with attributes (for setting preferences)

## Phase Later Requirements

* Codec re-negotiation
* Improved conferencing (dynamic sample rate support)
* Video transcoding (an implementation that proves it works)
* A&V sync in RTCP (research required)
* GTalk Video Support
* Support for unknown media types for pass-through (research required)
* Support for more than one stream of the same type (audio/video/text)
