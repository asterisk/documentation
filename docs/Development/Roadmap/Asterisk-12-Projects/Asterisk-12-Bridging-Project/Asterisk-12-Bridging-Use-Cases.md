DTMF Features
=============

!!! note Note
    1. For each DTMF initiated feature, it should be assumed that unless otherwise specified, the option only has an effect on the specified party. Thus, if a feature applies to the caller, the callee should **not** be able to use the feature.
    2. If the feature can be initiated by one party, then a configuration item exists to have it initiated by the other party as well. For example, if a caller can initiate a feature because of a configuration parameter, then another configuration parameter exists that lets the callee initiate the same feature.
    3. DTMF features are not specific to two-party calls, unless otherwise noted.
