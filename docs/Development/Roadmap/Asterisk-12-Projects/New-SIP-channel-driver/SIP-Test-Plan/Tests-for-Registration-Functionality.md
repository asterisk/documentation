title: Tests for Registration Functionality
pageid: 24248353
---

This page outlines registration tests for the new SIP channel driver.

All registration / un-registration tests will need to be run multiple times. Details on each iteration are given below:



| Iteration | Transport-specific options | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | bind = 127.0.0.1:5060protocol = udp | IPv4 UDP |
| 2 | bind = 127.0.0.1:5060protocol = tcp | IPv4 TCP |
| 3 | bind = [::1]:5060protocol = udp | IPv6 UDP |
| 4 | bind = [::1]:5060protocol = tcp | IPv6 TCP |

Note that if a specific test requires multiple iteration, the total number of test iterations will be the product of the test's number of iteration multiplied by the number of iterations in the above table.
