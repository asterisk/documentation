title: Tests for Basic Call Functionality
pageid: 22088169
---

This page outlines some basic call tests for the new SIP work in Asterisk.

Configuration for Tests
=======================

The configuration for these tests will all be made from a basic template. Some tests will require configuration to be added to the template. This will be specified in the test if necessary.




---

  
res_sip.conf  

```
[local-transport-template](!)
type=transport

[local-transport](local-transport-template)
; Place test-specific transport options here

[endpoint-template](!)
type=endpoint
context=default
transport=local-transport
allow=!all,ulaw,alaw

; alice is the caller
[alice](endpoint-template)
; Place alice-specific options here

; bob is the recipient of outbound calls
[bob](endpoint-template)
host=127.0.0.1:5062
; Place bob-specific options here

[auth-template](!)
type=auth

[alice-auth](auth-template)
username=alice
; Place alice-specific auth options here

[bob-auth](auth-template)
username=bob
; Place bob-specific auth options here
; Note: in the first iteration of tests on
; this page, there will never be any bob-specific
; auth options because we do not respond properly
; to auth challenges.

```

extensions.conf  

```
exten => echo,1,Answer()
same => n,Echo()
same => n,Hangup()

exten => playback,1,Answer()
same => n,Playback(hello-world)
same => n,Hangup()

exten => early,1,Progress()
same => n,Playback(hello-world,noanswer)
same => n,Hangup(INTERWORKING)

;This dialstring can be altered once endpoints can be used directly
exten => bob,1,Dial(PJSIP/sip:bob@127.0.0.1:5062,10)
same => n,Hangup()

exten => bobv6,1,Dial(PJSIP/sip:bob@[::1]:5062,10)
same => n,Hangup()

```

Incoming Call tests
===================

Incoming call tests involve a call placed from endpoint "alice" to Asterisk.

### Off-nominal paths

All off-nominal tests will need to be run multiple times. Details on each iteration are given below:



| Iteration | Transport-specific options | Comment |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | bind = 127.0.0.1:5060protocol = udp | IPv4 UDP |
| 2 | bind = 127.0.0.1:5060protocol = tcp | IPv4 TCP |
