Asterisk's SIP implementation has a need for supporting RFC 3265's event subscription system since the original `chan_sip` had support for it.


Requirements
============


Asterisk needs to fully support RFC 3265. Support should be approached in a modular fashion. It should be easy to write a module that handles a specific Event and Accept type. So for instance, a module should exist for the "presence" event and the "application/pidf" type. A separate module should exist for the "presence" event and the "application/xpidf" type.


Pubsub core
===========


The core of the pubsub feature comes in Asterisk's ability to register different event types as being handled. A module can register itself as a subscription handler for a specific event type. By doing so, Asterisk will know to call into that module when SUBSCRIBE or NOTIFY requests or responses are received for that event type.


At the base of it all is PJSIP's evsub framework. It takes care of a large portion of our job for us, like maintaining timers, maintaining the state of the subscription, and maintaining the state of the underlying dialog and transactions. Asterisk's pubsub core will sit on top of this and help further take care of automatic duties. The pubsub core will also help to associate PJSIP's event subscriptions with our own representation. Asterisk's pubsub core will also provide some abstractions for common dealings in PJSIP.


PJSIP's evsub API is quite extensive, and there is no good reason to try to completely hide it from subscription handlers. Thus Asterisk will not attempt to wrap every single thing that the evsub API provides. However, certain operations will be wrapped if there are additional duties that will be performed by the core or if it makes things easier to handle.


API
===


Base subscription structure
---------------------------


The pubsub framework is based around an opaque structure called `ast_sip_subscription`. This structure is the basis for all subscriptions and is used in the majority of functions in the API. The following are functions involving the `ast_sip_subscription`.

```
c
/*!
 * \brief Opaque structure representing an RFC 3265 SIP subscription
 */
struct ast_sip_subscription;

/*!
 * \brief Role for the subscription that is being created
 */
enum ast_sip_subscription_role {
 /* Sending SUBSCRIBEs, receiving NOTIFY */
 AST_SIP_SUBSCRIBER,
 /* Sending NOTIFYs, receiving SUBSCRIBE */
 AST_SIP_NOTIFIER,
};

/*!
 * \brief Create a new ast_sip_subscription structure
 *
 * \param handler The subsription handler for this subscription
 * \param role Whether we are acting as subscriber or notifier for this subscription
 * \param endpoint The endpoint involved in this subscription
 * \param rdata If acting as a notifier, the SUBSCRIBE request that triggered subscription creation
 */
struct ast_sip_subscription \*ast_sip_create_subscription(const struct ast_sip_subscription_handler \*handler,
 enum ast_sip_subscription_role role, struct ast_sip_endpoint \*endpoint, pjsip_rx_data \*rdata);


/*!
 * \brief Get the endpoint that is associated with this subscription
 *
 * \retval NULL Could not get endpoint
 * \retval non-NULL The endpoint
 */
struct ast_sip_endpoint \*ast_sip_subscription_get_endpoint(struct ast_sip_subscription \*sub);

/*!
 * \brief Get the serializer for the subscription
 *
 * Tasks that originate outside of a SIP servant thread should get the serializer
 * and push the task to the serializer.
 *
 * \param sub The subscription
 * \retval NULL Failure
 * \retval non-NULL The subscription's serializer
 */
struct ast_sip_serializer \*ast_sip_subscription_get_serializer(struct ast_sip_subscription \*sub);

/*!
 * \brief Get the underlying PJSIP evsub structure
 *
 * This is useful when wishing to call PJSIP's API calls in order to
 * create SUBSCRIBEs, NOTIFIES, etc. as well as get subscription state
 *
 * This function, as well as all methods called on the pjsip_evsub should
 * be done in a SIP servant thread.
 *
 * \param sub The subscription
 * \retval NULL Failure
 * \retval non-NULL The underlying pjsip_evsub
 */
pjsip_evsub \*ast_sip_subscription_get_evsub(struct ast_sip_subscription \*sub);

/*!
 * \brief Send a request created via a PJSIP evsub method
 *
 * Callers of this function should take care to do so within a SIP servant
 * thread.
 *
 * \param sub The subscription on which to send the request
 * \param tdata The request to send
 * \retval 0 Success
 * \retval non-zero Failure
 */
int ast_sip_subscription_send_request(struct ast_sip_subscription \*sub, pjsip_tx_data \*tdata);

/*!
 * \brief Alternative for ast_datastore_alloc()
 *
 * There are two major differences between this and ast_datastore_alloc()
 * 1) This allocates a refcounted object
 * 2) This will fill in a uid if one is not provided
 *
 * DO NOT call ast_datastore_free() on a datastore allocated in this
 * way since that function will attempt to free the datastore rather
 * than play nicely with its refcount.
 *
 * \param info Callbacks for datastore
 * \param uid Identifier for datastore
 * \retval NULL Failed to allocate datastore
 * \retval non-NULL Newly allocated datastore
 */
struct ast_datastore \*ast_sip_subscription_alloc_datastore(const struct ast_datastore_info \*info, const char \*uid);

/*!
 * \brief Add a datastore to a SIP subscription
 *
 * Note that SIP uses reference counted datastores. The datastore passed into this function
 * must have been allocated using ao2_alloc() or there will be serious problems.
 *
 * \param subscription The ssubscription to add the datastore to
 * \param datastore The datastore to be added to the subscription
 * \retval 0 Success
 * \retval -1 Failure
 */
int ast_sip_subscription_add_datastore(struct ast_sip_subscription \*subscription, struct ast_datastore \*datastore);

/*!
 * \brief Retrieve a subscription datastore
 *
 * The datastore retrieved will have its reference count incremented. When the caller is done
 * with the datastore, the reference counted needs to be decremented using ao2_ref().
 *
 * \param subscription The subscription from which to retrieve the datastore
 * \param name The name of the datastore to retrieve
 * \retval NULL Failed to find the specified datastore
 * \retval non-NULL The specified datastore
 */
struct ast_datastore \*ast_sip_subscription_get_datastore(struct ast_sip_subscription \*subscription, const char \*name);

/*!
 * \brief Remove a subscription datastore from the subscription
 *
 * This operation may cause the datastore's free() callback to be called if the reference
 * count reaches zero.
 *
 * \param subscription The subscription to remove the datastore from
 * \param name The name of the datastore to remove
 */
void ast_sip_subscription_remove_datastore(struct ast_sip_subscription \*subscription, const char \*name);

```

Subscription handlers
---------------------


Subscription handlers are what are responsible for handling specific event packages. Subscription handlers act as the barrier between Asterisk and PJSIP in that they take Asterisk data and make appropriate SIP requests. Subscription handlers also are called into by the pubsub core when changes in subscription state occur.

```
c

/*!
 * \brief Data for responses to SUBSCRIBEs and NOTIFIEs
 *
 * Some of PJSIP's evsub callbacks expect us to provide them
 * with data so that they can craft a response rather than have
 * us create our own response.
 *
 * The entire structure is itself optional, since the framework
 * will automatically respond with a 200 OK response if we do
 * not provide it with any data.
 */
struct ast_sip_subscription_response_data {

 int status_code;

 const char \*status_text;

Event publication
=================


In addition to supporting the SUBSCRIBE/NOTIFY methods specified in RFC 3265, we also wish to have support for the PUBLISH method defined in RFC 3903. PJSIP provides client support for event publication, but it has no such support for serving as an event state compositor. Unfortunately, Asterisk is much more likely to be needed as an event state compositor than as an event publication agent.


When acting as an event publication agent, Asterisk will use the PJSIP publish API directly. Any amount of state that needs to be kept can be done locally as needed.


When acting as an event state compositor, there will be a core set of Asterisk APIs to use instead, as well as a structure that can be used for accumulating state.
