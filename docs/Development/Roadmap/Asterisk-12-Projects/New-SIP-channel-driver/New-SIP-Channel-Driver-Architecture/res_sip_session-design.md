Overview
========


`res_sip_session` represents the "core" of SIP session operations. In the context of SIP, a "session" refers to a media session, such as a phone call. The SIP channel driver will be a consumer of the services provided by `res_sip_session`.


Startup procedure
=================


When `res_sip_session` starts up, it registers itself with `res_sip` as a service. This will cause `res_sip` to call into `res_sip_session` when new SIP messages come in. `res_sip_session` will handle those associated with sessions (i.e. INVITEs, and in-dialog REFERs, INFOs, UPDATEs, and PRACKs).


Public methods
==============
