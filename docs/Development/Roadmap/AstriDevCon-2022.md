Agenda

* Talks
	+ Yearly Update - Joshua Colp
	+ Video Handling - Florian/Maximilian
		- Developing cloud voice/video solution, not typical telephony aspect, use Asterisk as media engine
		- Intercom company
		- Using Kamailio + Asterisk in the cloud, Kamailio as registrar/SBC/LB, Asterisk as media/call engine, using chan_pjsip
		- Using early video
		- Dialplan + func_curl currently
		- ARI based implementation in early dev
		- Physical, mobile, web client
		- Moh_passthrough enabled, SDP offers get confused/incorrect
		- Have patch to do early media video
* Other Discussion
	+ Mailing Lists - Joshua Colp  

		- Some people still using mailing lists
		- Fine with moving to alternate solution
	+ ARI Usage - Joshua Colp
		- Joran struggling with missing small things, needs better documentation in some areas
		- Joran uncertain regarding transfers in ARI
		- Joran not all creation of objects accepts application, resulting in subscription not occurring so events can be missed
		- Ron issues with push configuration, identify with hostname resolving to multiple, match is reserved name in newer MySQL
		- Pascal set variable and get variable documentation may not mention dialplan functions (yay documentation is actually correct)
		- Yitzchak Pachtman would like to see a SIP NOTIFY mechanism in ARI
		- Mark Petersen AMI SIP NOTIFY issues with PJSIP, specifically custom text
		- Tone functionality not a huge item currently
	+ Confbridge Audio Quality Issues - Michael Cargile / Sylvain Boily
		- Only a few clients tested ConfBridge with Vicidial, not fully vetted, few clients that have tested, recordings/client fine, to carrier only every third word, may be load related, packet capture shows certain RTP packets aren't being sent
		- Experienced with Echo dialplan application
		- Local channels are involved
		- Some are virtualized, some physical
		- No packet loss concealment in bridges - Sylvain / Pascal, tried opus (multiple codec implementations) and no luck, packet loss results in large quality degradation, blocked on this issue
		- Sample configuration files value are good to test
		- AGI launching can take time, cause timing issues - Josh
		- Mixing bridge does not allow much configurability in ARI when creating bridge - Johan
		- Freeswitch with bridge + PLC handles packet loss best - Sylvain
	+ Codec Translation (from 18) - Mark Petersen
		- I hope to slot in more media stuff here
		- G729 as open source
		- It would be nice to have generic configuration to allow passthrough codecs to be easily added
		- codec_opus and FEC? no change currently
		- Alternate g729 codec modules exist
	+ Meetme vs ConfBridge - Michael Cargile
		- Does mixing happen in the dahdi driver? Yes
		- Is it possible to do this same thing in ConfBridge? Yes, but no module written for it
	+ MS Teams/AMR - Alexandro Picolini
		- Some people using MS Teams, but outside of Asterisk - Johan
	+ WebRTC Better Logging - Yitzchak Pachtman
		- Logging hard to understand, could be better, HTTPS / Websockets
		- fail2ban in FreePBX not triggering on WebRTC, lack of X-Forwarded-For / X-Real-IP
	+ Logging for taskprocessors when an overload or issue occurs is insufficient and can be confusing out of the box
	+ More prometheus logging and support in general - Mark Petersen
		- Counter for how many error / warning log notices have occurred, can provide insight when things happen
		- Joran using another tool (<https://vector.dev>) that looks at logs and pushes counters via prometheus for this, uses it for log aggregation to central server
	+ PJSIP Path - Sylvain Boily
		- Issues present on issue tracker from other reporters
		- Using Kamailio workaround of encoding in Contact the required information
		- Using Kamailio for Websocket SIP socket, using rtpengine for media, easier to scale
	+ Geoloc - Sylvain
		- Working very well
		- Encountered crash, double free, will put fix up, will be creating issue
		- Proof of concept to evaluate, not in production as of yet
	+ Usage of Debian with Asterisk has been fine - Sylvain, Joran, and Florian
	+ Queues - Pitzkey

		- Periodic announcements don't trigger on initial, FreePBX using chanspy which can go over MOH, would be better if it could be done initially
		- ARI makes it considerably easier+ Joran has higher level interface, users don't worry about scaling/SIP/Asterisk/etc
	+ Testsuite
		- Mark Petersen runs entire testsuite when doing changes, using Docker
		- Wazo not using Asterisk testsuite, have their own
	+ The Future - Joshua Colp
		- No concerns re: Github
		- STIR/SHAKEN
		- Media Experience Score
			* Accessibility via ARI would be nice
		- Media negotiation answer forwarding
	+ What would be nice
		- PLC for bridges, audio quality improvements, 1 to 1 is fine - Sylvain
		- Bridge module for mixing using DAHDI - Michael Cargile
		- Crash recovery - Pitzkey
		- Jitterbuffer settings in PJSIP configuration file (possible using dialplan functions and
