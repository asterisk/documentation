title: Media Format Rewrite
pageid: 27199677
---

History
=======

In the old times media formats were represented using a bit field. This was fast but had a few limitations. We were limited on how many there were and they also did not include any attribute information. It was strictly a "this is ulaw". This was changed and ast_format was created, which is a structure that contains additional information. Additionally ast_format_cap was created to act as a container and another mechanism was added to allow logic to be registered which performed format negotiation. Everywhere throughout the codebase the code was changed to use this strategy but unfortunately this came at a cost.

Performance analysis and profiling has shown that we spend an inordinate amount of time comparing, copying, and generally manipulating formats and their related structures. Basic prototyping has shown that there is a reasonably large performance improvement to be made in this area - this project is to overhaul the media format architecture and its usage in Asterisk to improve performance.

Use Cases
=========

The following, for the most part, assumes that the channels use RTP for media and SIP for signalling. Most use cases, however, will translate to any VoIP channel driver. DAHDI, as always, is its own thing.




!!! note 
    The Offer/Answer use cases below only apply to `chan_pjsip`. `chan_sip`, for better or worse, has its own fun rules about what codecs are offered and when.
[//]: # (end-note)


  
  

```
/* add_sdp */

 /* Now, start adding audio codecs. These are added in this order:
 - First what was requested by the calling channel
 - Then preferences in order from sip.conf device config for this peer/user
 - Then other codecs in capabilities, including video
*/  



---




Changing `chan_sip` is fraught with peril. As such, we're going to try and give the power/flexibility of how things are offered/answered to where we can better maintain/control the behaviour, which means `chan_pjsip`.

```

General Rules
-------------

1. For an inbound channel with a set of format capabilities, Asterisk should respond to that set of formats with the intersection of the offered capabilities and what is configured for the endpoint for that channel. The format preference order should be based on the configuration of the endpoint.
	1. If the system should accept a different set of codecs, a dialplan function and/or channel variable can be used to set which formats (and their preference order) are accepted on the channel at run-time. This would have to occur before the inbound channel is answered (via the MASTER_CHANNEL function and the U/M options in the dialplan).
	2. If the system would like to restrict in the device to a single format, a dialplan function and/or channel variable and/or configuration option can be set so that Asterisk will only ever respond with the preferred codec.
2. For an outbound channel, Asterisk should offer the formats that have been configured for that endpoint, with the format preference order based on the configuration of that channel's endpoint.
	1. If the system would like to restrict the outbound channel such that it only has a single format, a dialplan function/channel variable/configuration option can be used such that Asterisk only offers a single format.
3. Prior to entering a bridge, a dialplan function can be used to set whether or not that channel will attempt to make itself compatible with whatever is in the bridge with it. If a channel enters a bridge that has another channel in it with a format it supports, it will attempt to switch the channel to the bridged channel's format to facilitate native bridging. Note that this has no bearing in multi-party bridges, where everyone is transcoded.
4. At any point in time, a dialplan function can be used to set the allowed set of formats on the channel, with whatever ordering. These formats should be a subset of the allowed formats configured on that channel's endpoint. This will cause the channel to re-negotiate to the set of formats specified by the function.

The difference with this approach is that Asterisk will no longer always attempt to avoid transcoding. Instead, it will default to the rules configured in the `.conf` files, overriding as it can via the dialplan. Transcoding may be more likely in poorly configured systems, but it will also allow for much greater flexibility in the behaviour of Asterisk.

Single Channel
--------------

### Nominal Offer/Answer (Single Media Stream)




!!! info ""
    Each of the tests with a Single Media Stream should be repeated for each media stream that a channel driver supports, i.e., audio, video, RTT, etc.

      
[//]: # (end-info)



#### Offer Negotiation - Nominal

* Alice's phone offers some set of codecs in an INVITE request (example: ulaw,g729,ilbc), where all codecs are supported by Alice's endpoint
* Asterisk responds with an answer containing the codecs in the order specified by the offer




!!! tip 
    This should also verify various SDP offers:

    1. Lack of rtpmap attributes for specific codecs, e.g., 0 implies ulaw (See Table 2, RFC 1890)
    2. Non-standard rtpmap designations for codecs

    While these could be considered "off-nominal", they are allowed by the various RFCs and should be covered under a 'nominal negotiation', where the set of codecs offered match completely with what is configured in Asterisk

      
[//]: # (end-tip)



#### Offer Negotiation - Subset (Alice)

* Alice's phone offers a set of codecs in an INVITE request, where a subset of the codecs is supported by Alice's endpoint and some subset is not
* Asterisk modifies the origin line in the SDP, and responds with the set of codecs that are allowed based on the intersection of the offered codecs and the configured codecs for the endpoint

#### Offer Negotiation - Subset (Asterisk)

* Alice's phone offers a set of codecs in an INVITE request, where the codecs offered is a subset of the codecs supported by Alice's endpoint
* Asterisk responds with an answer containing the codecs in the order specified by the offer

#### Offer Negotiation - Preferred Codec Only (Alice's preference)

* Alice's phone offers a set of codecs in an INVITE request, where all codecs are supported by Alice's endpoint
* Asterisk modifies the origin line in the SDP, and responds with only the preferred codec in the offer

#### Offer Negotiation - Preferred Codec Only (Asterisk's preference)

* Alice's phone offers a set of codecs in an INVITE request, where all codecs are supported by Alice's endpoint
* Asterisk modifies the origin line in the SDP, and responds with only the preferred codec configured via the dialplan/configuration file

#### Offer Negotiation - Preferred Codec List

* Alice's phone offers a set of codecs in an INVITE request, where all codecs are supported by Alice's endpoint
* Asterisk modifies the origin line in the SDP, and responds with a subset of the codecs in the offer re-ordered per the preference order defined via the dialplan/configuration file

#### Offer Negotiation - packetization

* Alice's phone offers a set of codecs in an INVITE request, where the preferred codec has a ptime attribute indicating a different packetization
* Asterisk responds with the codecs in the offer, and sends RTP to the endpoint with the appropriate packetization

### Nominal Offer/Answer (Multiple Media Streams)

All use cases covered in Nominal Offer/Answer (Single Media Stream) apply here as well, save that there should be multiple streams of different types. Asterisk should treat the preferred codec offer in the same fashion for each stream independently; that is, if the preferred codec list is ulaw,g722,h261,h264, then the preferred audio codec is ulaw and the preferred video codec is h261.




!!! info ""
    Each of the following tests be repeated to include multiple media streams in various combinations:

    * Audio + Video
    * Video + Text
    * Audio + Text
    * Audio + Video + Text
      
[//]: # (end-info)



### Restricted Offer/Answer (Single Stream)

#### No codecs

* Alice's phone offers no codecs in an INVITE request with an SDP.
* Asterisk responds with an equivalent answer.

#### Restricted flow

* Alice's phone offers a set of codecs in an INVITE request, where the media is set to sendonly (phone => Asterisk)
* Asterisk responds with the codecs in the offer, where the media is set to recvonly.

### Restricted Offer/Answer (Multiple Streams)

Each scenario in Restricted Offer/Answer applies, only with both an audio stream as well as a video stream. Either or both stream can be indicated to be sendonly, or can be sent with no codecs.

### Invalid Format Offer/Answer (Single Stream)

#### Offer Invalid Codec (one)

* Alice's phone offers a set of codecs in an INVITE request, where at least one codec is not supported by Alice's endpoint
* Asterisk responds with the subset of the codecs that were offered that it does support, using the preference order of the offer

#### Offer Invalid Codec (all)

* Alice's phone offers a set of codecs in an INVITE request, where none of the codecs are supported by Alice's endpoint
* Asterisk responds with a 488.

#### Offer Invalid Attribute

* Alice's phone offers a set of codecs, where additional attributes are provided that are invalid:
	+ An invalid rtpmap attribute for an unknown media format
	+ An invalid attribute (or unknown attribute) for a known media format
	+ An improperly formatted media description line
* Asterisk responds with a 488.

### Invalid Format Offer/Answer (Multiple Stream)

All of the scenarios in Invalid Format Offer/Answer apply, only with a single audio and a single video stream. Streams can be declined, or the entire offer can be declined with a 488 as appropriate.

Multiple Channels
-----------------

### Nominal Offer/Answer

#### Failed translation paths

* Alice sends an INVITE request with an offer containing a set of codecs configured for Alice's endpoint
* Asterisk dials Bob with his endpoint's codecs, where the codecs for Bob's endpoint are not the same as Alice's. For each codec that does not have a translation path to Alice's codecs, those codecs are not offered.
* Bob responds with one of this acceptable codecs. Asterisk responds to Alice with her codecs.
* Alice and Bob enter a bridge together and their media is transcoded based on the current formats sent by their endpoints.

[//]: # (end-note)





Design
======

The Present
-----------

### struct ast_format

Media formats in Asterisk are now represented using a large (~320 byte) sized data structure. This is done because the data structure itself is not a reference counted object and thus carries no guarantee that associated information attached to it will be disposed of. The large size of the data structure is due to needing additional space for optional media format attributes.

### ast_format_copy

Copying formats now requires copying this large amount of memory. While one would think this occurs infrequently in practice this can occur more than 5 times for a single frame passing through Asterisk.

### ast_format_cmp

Comparing formats is no longer cheap either. Each comparison requires doing a container lookup to see if any additional logic is registered to augment the comparison operation. As code within Asterisk needs to be aware of when formats change this can occur 4 or more times for a single frame passing through Asterisk.

### Container lookup using ast_format as key

Since comparing formats are no longer cheap using the ast_format as a container key is extremely expensive.

### Assumptions no longer true

There are assumptions throughout the tree that media format related operations are cheap when in reality they are anything but. An example would be reusable frames. Instead of setting the frames up with the information they require at initialization they are set each time the frame is returned.

The Future
----------

### Codecs

While past media work has provided us room to add codecs within the codebase there is no dynamic manner available of doing so. For efficient storage of media formats this will need to change. The ability to add codecs to the core will be made available, with the core adding the common codecs that Asterisk is already aware of. The RTP engine API will also be extended to allow SDP specific information to be added. This will provide a truly dynamic and flexible way of adding codecs, with the added benefit that the numerical values for codecs can be used as indexes into arrays.

```
struct ast_codec {
 /*! Unique identifier for this codec, starts at  */
 unsigned int id;
 /*! Original Asterisk identifier, optiona */
 uint64_t original_id;
 /*! Name for this code */
 const char \*name;
 /*! Brief descriptio */
 const char \*description;
 /*! Type of media this codec is fo */
 enum ast_format_type type;
 /*! Number of samples carrie */
 unsigned int samples;
 /*! \brief Minimum length of media that can be carried (in milliseconds */
 unsigned int minimum_ms;
 /*! \brief Maximum length of media that can be carried (in milliseconds */
 unsigned int maximum_ms;
 /*! \brief The number of milliseconds the length can be incremented b */
 unsigned int increment_ms;
 /*! Default length of media carried (in milliseconds */
 unsigned int default_ms;
 /*! Whether the media can be smoothed or no */
 unsigned int smooth;
 /*! Callback function for getting the number of samples in a fram */
 int (\*get_samples)(struct ast_frame \*frame);
 /*! Callback function for getting the length of media based on number of sample */
 int (\*get_length)(int samples);
};

int ast_codec_register(struct ast_codec \*codec);

struct ast_codec \*ast_codec_get(const char \*name, enum ast_format_type type, unsigned int samples);

```

Codec structures will be immutable once registered and created only once. If a user of the API wants to retrieve a codec they will use ast_codec_get with the provided information.

### struct ast_format

The ast_format structure will become an astobj2 allocated object as follows:

```
struct ast_format {
 struct ast_codec \*codec;
 void \*attribute_data;
 struct ast_format_attr_interface \*interface;
};

```

Because it is astobj2 allocated additional information can be stored within it, such as a pointer to attribute information and a pointer to the attribute interface to use with it. This reduces the size of the structure by quite a lot and removes the need for container lookups on comparison.

This structure will also be immutable once exposed outside the scope of what has allocated it by any means (such as being stored in an ast_format_cap and then returned).

Another bonus is that for some cases the format structure can be reused, such as when parsing and interpreting "allow" or "disallow" options. This reduces memory usage some more.

Attribute information storage will be left up to the attribute interface implementation.

### struct ast_format_cap

The ast_format_cap structure currently internally uses an ao2 hash table to store formats. Leveraging the fact that codecs have a unique identifier we can turn this into a vector with the codec identifier as the index.

```
struct ast_format_cap {
 AST_VECTOR(, struct ast_format \*) formats;
 AST_VECTOR(, int) framing;
 AST_VECTOR(, int) preference;
};

```

This presents an easy mechanism to see if a format is present in the structure.

The framing and preference order is now also made available directly in the cap structure itself, allowing this information to persist in additional places.

### struct ast_format_pref

The ast_format_pref structure currently uses a fixed sized array of formats (not pointers). This structure is no longer required since the framing and preference order has now been moved into the cap structure directly.

### ast_format_copy

The ast_format_copy operation will simply be incrementing the reference count of the format and returning it.




!!! note 
    I don't foresee needing a function which does a deep copy. In practice you don't copy a media format and then modify it.

      
[//]: # (end-note)



### ast_format_cmp

Comparing formats is similar to the previous implementation except instead of doing a container lookup the pointer to the attribute interface is now directly on the structure.

### AST_CONTROL_FORMAT_CHANGE

If media is received with a format that differs from previous frames an AST_CONTROL_FORMAT_CHANGE control frame will be inserted ahead of the new frame at the ingress point. Any code which relies on the format will use this control frame to update themselves to the new format. No format comparisons should be used to determine this. The control frame should be used instead.

### RTP Engine API

The RTP engine API currently uses an AO2 container for storing payload mapping information. Since this mapping occurs frequently this comes at a cost.

For mapping from payload to format a fixed array with the payload as the index will be used.

For mapping from format to payload a vector with the format codec id as the index will be used.

### Format Usage

#### Creating a format

For cases where a format has to be created a new API call, ast_format_create, which takes in a codec will be made available.

```
struct ast_format \*ast_format_create(struct ast_codec \*codec);

```



Example:

```
static void example(void)
{
 struct ast_codec \*codec = ast_codec_get("ulaw", AST_FORMAT_TYPE_AUDIO, 8000);
 struct ast_format \*format;

 if (!codec) {
 return;
 }

 format = ast_format_create(codec);
 ao2_ref(codec, -1);

 ao2_cleanup(format);
}

```



#### Setting attributes

Attribute information can be set on a format by using the ast_format_attribute_set function. To keep things dynamic it takes in both a string for attribute name and value.

```
int ast_format_attribute_set(struct ast_format \*format, const char \*attribute, const char \*value); 

```



Example:

```
static void test_example(void)
{
 struct ast_codec \*codec = ast_codec_get("silk", AST_FORMAT_TYPE_AUDIO, 8000);
 struct ast_format \*format;

 if (!codec) {
 return;
 }

 format = ast_format_create(codec);
 ao2_ref(codec, -1);

 if (!format) {
 return;
 }

 ast_format_attribute_set(format, "rate", "24000");
 ast_format_attribute_set(format, "rate", "16000");
 ast_format_attribute_set(format, "rate", "12000");
 ast_format_attribute_set(format, "rate", "8000");
 ao2_ref(format, -1);
}

```



!!! note 
    Since format attributes are stored in an implementation specific manner there is no API for getting/retrieving/clearing/etc attributes.

      
[//]: # (end-note)



### Format Capabilities Usage

#### Creating and destroying format capabilities structure

The function to allocate a capabilities structure is unchanged but the format capabilities structure is now a reference counted object to reduce copying. As a result there is no explicit function to destroy a structure.

```
struct ast_format_cap \*ast_format_cap_alloc(enum ast_format_cap_flags flags);

```



Example:

```
static void example(void)
{
 struct ast_format_cap \*caps = ast_format_cap_alloc(AST_FORMAT_CAP_FLAG_NOLOCK);

 ao2_ref(caps, -1);
}

```

#### Adding a format to the capabilities structure

This is slightly changed from the existing API in that the format passed in is not const. The implementation also increments the reference count of the format instead of copying it.

```
void ast_format_cap_add(struct ast_format_cap \*cap, struct ast_format \*format);

```



Example:

```
static void example(void)
{
 struct ast_codec \*codec = ast_codec_get("ulaw", AST_FORMAT_TYPE_AUDIO, 8000);
 struct ast_format \*format;
 struct ast_format_cap \*caps;

 if (!codec) {
 return;
 }

 format = ast_format_create(codec);
 ao2_ref(codec, -1);

 if (!format) {
 return;
 }

 caps = ast_format_cap_alloc(AST_FORMAT_CAP_FLAG_NOLOCK);
 if (!caps) {
 ao2_ref(format, -1);
 return;
 }

 ast_format_cap_add(caps, format);

 ao2_ref(format, -1);
 ao2_ref(caps, -1);
}

```



!!! note 
    Ordering of format additions to a capabilities structure is preserved and forms the format preference order.

      
[//]: # (end-note)



#### Capabilities structure manipulation

Numerous functions manipulate the capabilities structure itself. These are used to copy formats between structures, duplicate them, etc. These will go unchanged except internally they will no longer duplicate the format. Instead they will increment the reference count.

```
void ast_format_cap_add_all_by_type(struct ast_format_cap \*cap, enum ast_format_type type);
void ast_format_cap_add_all(struct ast_format_cap \*cap);
void ast_format_cap_append(struct ast_format_cap \*dst, const struct ast_format_cap \*src);
void ast_format_cap_copy(struct ast_format_cap \*dst, const struct ast_format_cap \*src);
struct ast_format_cap \*ast_format_cap_dup(const struct ast_format_cap \*src);
int ast_format_cap_is_empty(const struct ast_format_cap \*cap);
int ast_format_cap_remove(struct ast_format_cap \*cap, struct ast_format \*format);
void ast_format_cap_remove_bytype(struct ast_format_cap \*cap, enum ast_format_type type);
void ast_format_cap_remove_all(struct ast_format_cap \*cap);

```

#### Capabilities structure iteration

As the capabilities structure is now stored using an array iteration will involve two functions, ast_format_cap_count and ast_format_cap_get, which returns the number of formats in the structure and gets a specific one based on index.

```
size_t ast_format_cap_count(const struct ast_format_cap \*cap);
struct ast_format \*ast_format_cap_get(const struct ast_format_cap \*cap, int index);

```



Example:

```
static void example(void)
{
 struct ast_format_cap \*caps = ast_format_cap_alloc(AST_FORMAT_CAP_FLAG_NOLOCK);
 size_t count;
 int index;

 if (!caps) {
 return;
 }

 for (count = ast_format_cap_count(caps), index = 0; index < count; index++) {
 struct ast_format \*format = ast_format_cap_get(caps, index);

 ao2_ref(format, -1);
 }

 ao2_ref(caps, -1);
}

```

#### Framing size

The framing size controls the length of media frames (in milliseconds). Previously this was stored in a separate structure but has now been rolled into ast_format_cap. To allow control two API calls will be added.

```
void ast_format_cap_framing_set(struct ast_format_cap \*cap, const struct ast_format \*format, unsigned int framing);
unsigned int ast_format_cap_framing_get(const struct ast_format_cap \*cap, const struct ast_format \*format);

```



Example:

```
static void example(void)
{
 struct ast_codec \*codec = ast_codec_get("ulaw", AST_FORMAT_TYPE_AUDIO, 8000);
 struct ast_format \*format;
 struct ast_format_cap \*caps;
 unsigned int framing;
 
 if (!codec) {
 return;
 }
 
 format = ast_format_create(codec);
 ao2_ref(codec, -1);
 
 if (!format) {
 return;
 }
 
 caps = ast_format_cap_alloc(AST_FORMAT_CAP_FLAG_NOLOCK);
 if (!caps) {
 ao2_ref(format, -1);
 return;
 }
 
 ast_format_cap_add(caps, format);
 ast_format_cap_framing_set(caps, format, 20);
 framing = ast_format_cap_framing_get(caps, format);
 
 ao2_ref(format, -1);
 ao2_ref(caps, -1);
}

```

#### Getting joint capabilities

Joint capabilities are the common compatible formats between two capabilities structure. These will be done using the existing API functions but will now take preference order into consideration. This will be done by using the order of the first capabilities structure passed in.

```
struct ast_format_cap \*ast_format_cap_joint(const struct ast_format_cap \*cap_preferred, const struct ast_format_cap \*cap_secondary);
int ast_format_cap_joint_copy(const struct ast_format_cap \*cap1, const struct ast_format_cap \*cap2, struct ast_format_cap \*result);
int ast_format_cap_joint_append(const struct ast_format_cap \*cap1, const struct ast_format_cap \*cap2, struct ast_format_cap \*result);

```



Example:

```
static void example(void)
{
 struct ast_codec \*codec = ast_codec_get("ulaw", AST_FORMAT_TYPE_AUDIO, 8000);
 struct ast_format \*format;
 struct ast_format_cap \*caps0, \*caps1, \*joint;
 
 if (!codec) {
 return;
 }
 
 format = ast_format_create(codec);
 ao2_ref(codec, -1);
 
 if (!format) {
 return;
 }
 
 caps0 = ast_format_cap_alloc(AST_FORMAT_CAP_FLAG_NOLOCK);
 if (!caps0) {
 ao2_ref(format, -1);
 return;
 }
 
 ast_format_cap_add(caps0, format);
 ao2_ref(format, -1);

 caps1 = ast_format_cap_alloc(AST_FORMAT_CAP_FLAG_NOLOCK);
 if (!caps1) {
 ao2_ref(caps0, -1);
 return;
 }

 ast_format_cap_copy(caps1, caps0);

 joint = ast_format_cap_joint(caps0, caps1);

 ao2_cleanup(joint);
 ao2_ref(caps0, -1);
 ao2_ref(caps1, -1);
}

```
