title: StasisStart/StasisEnd Test plan
pageid: 30279826
---

StasisStart and StasisEnd events are the most crucial events to be sent since Stasis applications use these to determine if channels are in or not in their applications any longer. The problem is that the process for determining channel's existence in Stasis is not as straight-forward as seeing the channel enter and exit the Stasis() dialplan application. This page's intent is to detail a list of tests that will ensure that StasisStart and StasisEnd messages are received when we expect and are not received when not expected.
