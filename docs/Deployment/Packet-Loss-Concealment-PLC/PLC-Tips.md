One of the restrictions mentioned is that PLC will only be used when two audio channels are bridged together. Through the use of Local channels, you can create a bridge even if the call is, for all intents and purposes, one-legged. By using a combination of the /n and /j suffixes for a Local channel, one can ensure that the Local channel is not optimized out of the talk path and that a jitter buffer is applied to the Local channel as well. Consider the following simple dialplan:

```
 
[example]
exten => 1,1,Playback(tt-weasels)
exten => 2,1,Dial(Local/1@example/nj) 

```

When dialing extension 1, PLC cannot be used because there will be only a single channel involved. When dialing extension 2, however, Asterisk will create a bridge between the incoming channel and the Local channel, thus allowing PLC to be used.
