Network Security
================

If you install Asterisk and use the "make samples" command to install a demonstration configuration, Asterisk will open a few ports for accepting VoIP calls. Check the channel configuration files for the ports and IP addresses. 

If you enable the manager interface in manager.conf, please make sure that you access manager in a safe environment or protect it with SSH or other VPN solutions. 

For all TCP/IP connections in Asterisk, you can set ACL lists that will permit or deny network access to Asterisk services. Please check the "permit" and "deny" configuration options in manager.conf and the VoIP channel configurations - i.e. sip.conf and iax.conf. 

The IAX2 protocol supports strong RSA key authentication as well as AES encryption of voice and signaling. The SIP channel supports TLS encryption of the signaling, as well as SRTP (encrypted media).
