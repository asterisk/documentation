Two other options exist, that act as modifiers to the privacy options 'P' and 'p'. They are 'N' and 'n'. You can enter them as dialing options, but they only affect things if P or p are also in the options. 

'**N**' says, "Only screen the call if no CallerID is present". So, if a callerID were supplied, it will come straight thru to your extension. 

'**n**' says, "Don't save any introductions". Folks will be asked to supply an introduction ("At the tone, say your name") every time they call. Their introductions will be removed after the callee makes a choice on how to handle the call. Whether the P option or the p option is used, the incoming caller will have to supply their intro every time they call.
