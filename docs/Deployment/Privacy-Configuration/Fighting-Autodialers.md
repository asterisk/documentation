Zapateller detects if callerid is present, and if not, plays the da-da-da tones that immediately precede messages like, "I'm sorry, the number you have called is no longer in service." 


Most humans, even those with unlisted/callerid-blocked numbers, will not immediately slam the handset down on the hook the moment they hear the three tones. But autodialers seem pretty quick to do this. 


I just counted 40 hangups in Zapateller over the last year in my CDR's. So, that is possibly 40 different telemarketers/charities that have hopefully slashed my back-waters, out-of-the-way, humble home phone number from their lists. 


I highly advise Zapateller for those seeking the nirvana of "privacy".
