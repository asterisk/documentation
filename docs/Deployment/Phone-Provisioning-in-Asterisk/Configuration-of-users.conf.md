The asterisk-gui sets up extensions, SIP/IAX2 peers, and a host of other settings. User-specific settings are stored in users.conf. If the asterisk-gui is not being used, manual entries to users.conf can be made.


### The [general] section


There are only two settings in the general section of users.conf that apply to phone provisioning: localextenlength which maps to template variable EXTENSION_LENGTH and vmexten which maps to the VOICEMAIL_EXTEN variable.


### Individual Users


To enable auto-provisioning of a phone, the user in users.conf needs to have:

```

... 
autoprov=yes
macaddress=deadbeef4dad
profile=polycom

```

The profile is optional if a default_profile is set in phoneprov.conf. The following is a sample users.conf entry, with the template variables commented next to the settings:

```

[6001]
callwaiting = yes 
context = numberplan-custom-1 
hasagent = no 
hasdirectory = yes 
hasiax = no 
hasmanager = no 
hassip = yes 
hasvoicemail = yes 
host = dynamic 
mailbox = 6001 
threewaycalling = yes 
deletevoicemail = no 
autoprov = yes 
profile = polycom 
directmedia = no 
nat = no 
fullname = User Two ; ${DISPLAY_NAME} 
secret = test ; ${SECRET} 
username = 6001 ; ${USERNAME} 
macaddress = deadbeef4dad ; ${MAC} 
label = 6001 ; ${LABEL} 
cid_number = 6001 ; ${CALLERID}

```

The variables above, are the user-specfic variables that can be substituted into dynamic filenames and config templates.
