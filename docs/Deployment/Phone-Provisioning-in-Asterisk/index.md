Asterisk includes basic phone provisioning support through the res_phoneprov module. The current implementation is based on a templating system using Asterisk dialplan function and variable substitution and obtains information to substitute into those templates from phoneprov.conf and users.conf. A profile and set of templates is provided for provisioning Polycom phones. Note that res_phoneprov is currently limited to provisioning a single user per device.
