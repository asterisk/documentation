title: SayDigits, SayNumber, SayAlpha, and SayPhonetic Applications
pageid: 4817381

While not exactly related to auto-attendant menus, we'll introduce some applications to read back various pieces of information back to the caller. The **SayDigits()** and **SayNumber()** applications read the specified number back to caller. To use the **SayDigits()** and **SayNumber()** application simply pass it the number you'd like it to say as the first parameter.


The **SayDigits()** application reads the specified number one digit at a time. For example, if you called **SayDigits(123)**, Asterisk would read back "one two three". On the other hand, the **SayNumber()** application reads back the number as if it were a whole number. For example, if you called **SayNumber(123)** Asterisk would read back "one hundred twenty three".


The **SayAlpha()** and **SayPhonetic()** applications are used to spell an alphanumeric string back to the caller. The **SayAlpha()** reads the specified string one letter at a time. For example, **SayAlpha(hello)** would read spell the word "hello" one letter at a time. The **SayPhonetic()** spells back a string one letter at a time, using the international phonetic alphabet. For example, **SayPhonetic(hello)** would read back "Hotel Echo Lima Lima Oscar".


We'll use these four applications to read back various data to the caller througout this guide. In the meantime, please feel free to add some sample extensions to your dialplan to try out these applications. Here are some examples:

```javascript title=" " linenums="1"
exten => 6592,1,SayDigits(123)
exten => 6593,1,SayNumber(123)
exten => 6594,1,SayAlpha(hello)
exten => 6595,1,SayPhonetic(hello)

```
