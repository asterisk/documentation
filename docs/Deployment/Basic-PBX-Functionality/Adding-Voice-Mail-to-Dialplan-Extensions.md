Adding voicemail to the extensions is quite simple. The [Asterisk voicemail module](/Configuration/Applications/Voicemail) provides two key applications for dealing with voice mail. The first, named **[VoiceMail()](/Latest_API/API_Documentation/Dialplan_Applications/VoiceMail)**, allows a caller to leave a voice mail message in the specified mailbox. The second, called **[VoiceMailMain()](/Latest_API/API_Documentation/Dialplan_Applications/VoiceMailMain)**, allows the mailbox owner to retrieve their messages and change their greetings.
