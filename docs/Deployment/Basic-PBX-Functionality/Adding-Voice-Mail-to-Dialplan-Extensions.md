Adding voicemail to the extensions is quite simple. The Asterisk voicemail module provides two key applications for dealing with voice mail. The first, named **VoiceMail()**, allows a caller to leave a voice mail message in the specified mailbox. The second, called **VoiceMailMain()**, allows the mailbox owner to retrieve their messages and change their greetings.
